# Business-Analytics: Customer Segmentation using K-means


## Introduction
Customer segmentation is one of the most successful applications of Machine Learning (ML), in partciular unsupervised ML, for business and marketing analytics. With the abundance of customer data gathered by companies, it is finally possible to start exploring the customer profiles in depth and identifying behavioural patterns and traits of customers. Customer profiling helps companies target with precision specific subsets of their customer base to boost growth, increase revenues and ensure long-term customer loyalty.
 Unfortunately, there is no one recipe for performing cluster analysis. Is is rather an iterative process that combines rigorous knowledge of Machine Learning, business accumen, and an open-mind for exploration.

In the following report we **will dive into the following topics**:

- How to perform K-means unsing scikit learn  
- Theoretical background behind K-means
- Useful parameters and attributes of scikit learn's KMeans
- Heuristics to choose the best value for K (Elbow method, Silhoutte Plots, Rules of Thumb)
- 3D (and 2D) Visualisation of Clusters
- Cluster interpretation
